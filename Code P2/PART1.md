## Problems Encountered & Solutions

We had a problem with the alien movement that the alien stops without any of the 3 execptional objects which are they : 1. the rock 2. one of the boundaries 3. hits a zombie and the zombie survives the hit.
We took a bit of time of modifying the value of the classes but eventually we modified it.
